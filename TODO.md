 - try to make smarter deps parsing based on lemmas order
 - integrate some deep learning based deps parsing possibly
 - rework tests
 - use ordered tests instead of just serial
 - use error correction after processing (add Russian support to nlprule https://github.com/bminixhofer/nlprule/issues/46)
